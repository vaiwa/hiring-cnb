# Task

Create a simple React app (don’t use NextJS please), which:

1. When it starts, retrieve the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank.

   - API URL: https://www.cnb.cz/en/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-market/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/daily.txt

   - Documentation: https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/Format-of-the-foreign-exchange-market-rates/

2. Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays a list to the user in the UI.

3. Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after submitting (clicking a button or in real-time) sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.

4. Commit your code throughout your work and upload the resulting codebase into a Github repo.

5. Deploy the app so it can be viewed online (it doesn’t matter where - e.q. Vercel, Netflify, etc.).

6. Add automated tests which might be appropriate to ensure that your solution is working correctly.

7. Tech stack: React (+ Hooks), TypeScript, Styled Components, React Query.

Overall: Keep the code simple and the UI nice and easy to use for the user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
