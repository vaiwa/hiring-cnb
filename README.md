# Task

Create a simple React app (don’t use NextJS please), which:

1. When it starts, retrieve the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank.

   API URL: https://www.cnb.cz/en/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-market/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/daily.txt

   Documentation: https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/Format-of-the-foreign-exchange-market-rates/

2. Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays a list to the user in the UI.

3. Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after submitting (clicking a button or in real-time) sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.

4. Commit your code throughout your work and upload the resulting codebase into a Github repo.

5. Deploy the app so it can be viewed online (it doesn’t matter where - e.q. Vercel, Netflify, etc.).
6. Add automated tests which might be appropriate to ensure that your solution is working correctly.

7. Tech stack: React (+ Hooks), TypeScript, Styled Components, React Query.

Overall: Keep the code simple and the UI nice and easy to use for the user.

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve api
npx nx build frontend --watch
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build api
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project api
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
